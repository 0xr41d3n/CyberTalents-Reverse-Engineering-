let’s start our Reverse Engineering journey with a challenge called shifty as a first observation the challenge title “Sh1F77y” is written in leet

language which mean shifty so it’s obvious that something related to cryptography let’s not rush.

The challenge is c programming code that is taking a 13 character lenght password as an argument and check it either it’s true or flase .

in a deep code analysis we could notice that it’s a substitution cipher it’s taking a plain text and shift it with an array keys I’ve written a

simple python code to break it , After running python script you'll get the flag as :

flag { this_is_13337 }
